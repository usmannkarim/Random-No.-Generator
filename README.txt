Random Number Guessing Game - A Python Project

This project was assigned to me as a task The goal was to create a random number generator that acts as a guessing game. The project consists of a single Python file that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess the number.

The program uses the random module in Python to generate a random number between 1 and 100. The user is given 10 chances to guess the number, and the program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. If the user correctly guesses the number, the program will output a victory message.

This project is a fun and engaging way to practice basic programming concepts such as control structures, input/output, and working with random numbers.

Whether you are looking to learn the basics of Python programming or just want to test your guessing skills, this Random Number Guessing Game is the perfect project for you
